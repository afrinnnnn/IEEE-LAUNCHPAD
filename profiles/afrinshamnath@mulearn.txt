# Afrin Shamnath

### About Me

 Hey there! I’m Afrin Shamnath, an Electronics and Communication Engineering student with a deep curiosity about how things work — and an even deeper curiosity about people and ideas. Whether it's diving into a technical topic or having a great conversation, I love exploring new perspectives.

I’ve always believed in learning beyond the classroom. That’s why I’ve been actively involved with communities like IEEE and MuLearn, where I’ve had the chance to lead, organize, and collaborate on events that bring people together to learn and grow. Being part of these spaces has helped me build leadership skills, discover my strengths, and connect with inspiring minds from across Kerala.

Outside of academics and volunteering, I’m someone who thrives on stories — whether that’s through books, movies, or talking to new people. I’m also a swimming enthusiast, and I find it’s the perfect way to clear my mind and stay energized.

I speak English, Malayalam, and Hindi, which helps me feel at home in diverse groups and makes communication one of my biggest strengths.


## Portfolio Highlights

#### Leadership and Influence:

- IEEE Member (Campus + Kerala Section):
I’ve helped plan and run events at both college and state levels. It’s been a great way to step out of my comfort zone and work with amazing teams.
-MuLearn Executive Committee:
From volunteering at events to now being part of the core team, MuLearn has been a huge part of my growth. I love how it brings people together to learn, collaborate, and support one another

#### Networking:

- Explain your networking skills and how you plan to engage with the communitys. Outline how you will influence and lead others in your respective field.

#### Career Plan:

 While I love tech, I’ve found myself increasingly drawn to management and leadership. That’s why I’m planning to pursue an MBA — to build a career where I can blend my technical background with people skills and strategy. I want to work in roles where I can lead teams, solve real-world problems, and create positive impact.

In the near future, I’m looking forward to gaining work experience, learning how organizations operate, and preparing for a meaningful management journey ahead

#### Thoughts on Kerala's Tech Ecosystem:

I genuinely think Kerala has something special. There’s so much talent here — especially among students — and communities like IEEE and MuLearn are already helping that talent shine. But there’s still room to grow.

What I’d love to see more of is support for young people not just in coding or tech, but in leadership, communication, and entrepreneurship too. If we combine that with better infrastructure and collaboration across institutions, Kerala can become a place where ideas don’t just start — they thrive.

And I’m excited to be a part of that.
